This is written for new users on how they should
organize their repositories on the HPC, how to pull from the two lab repositories,
and how to correctly set up their shell environments based on the location of our scripts

First, a new user must have access to the repo, because it is private.
The following are true for DeYonker-lab-scripts and a similar procedure applies to the RINRUS repo.
Navigate to your workshop folder and tell git that you want to create a git repository here and keep
a record of your project by typing,

      $ git init

now, git knows that we have started a project.
then type in,

      $ git pull https://github.com/natedey/DeYonker-lab-scripts

now, you have all files of the repo and can use python scripts present in this repo.
Python scripts, themselves have their own help on how to use them.
At the end, for using any scrip in the DeYonker-lab-scripts folder, it must be typed,

python3   working_dir/python_script argument (if any is required)
